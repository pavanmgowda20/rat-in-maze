# rat-in-maze
This repository solves the classic "Rat in a Maze" problem using the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm.  The maze is represented as a 2D matrix, where 0 indicates a blocked path and 1 indicates an open path.  The program reads the maze from an input file and finds a valid path from the source (top-left corner) to the destination .
